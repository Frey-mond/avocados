# Instructions

## Library Setup

This project has a variety of dependencies that need to be installed before you `main.py` can be run.

For conda environments

```console
conda install pandas pickle seaborn plotly scikit-learn matplotlib
```

For python environments

```console
pip install pandas seaborn pickle plotly scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

### Folders

`/data` is where the datasets used to generate the results in `report.md` are stored.
`/output` is where plots are output and saved.

### Files

`main.py` is the central file for running all the tasks outlined in `report.md`.

`test.py` is for testing joins and dataset values to ensure we've done the filtering and joins correctly.

`task_1.py` implements [task 1](https://github.com/Frey-mond/avocados/blob/main/report.md#research-questions) as outlined in `report.md`

`task2.py` implements [task 2](https://github.com/Frey-mond/avocados/blob/main/report.md#research-questions) outlined in `report.md`

`task3.py` implements [task 3](https://github.com/Frey-mond/avocados/blob/main/report.md#research-questions) as outlined in `report.md`

## Run Project

After installing libraries, run `main.py` to generate the plots and results used in `report.md`. We recommend looking at the plots generated by running `main.py` for the interactive plotly plots.
