## Project Structure

### Folders

`/data` is where the datasets used to generate the results in `report.md` are stored.
`/output` is where plots are output and saved.


### Files

`main.py` is the central file for running all the tasks outlined in `report.md`.

`test.py` is for testing the functions from `task1.py`, `task2.py`, and `task3.py`.

`task_1.py` implements [task 1](https://github.com/Frey-mond/avocados/blob/main/report.md#research-questions) as outlined in `report.md`

`task2.py` implements [task 2](https://github.com/Frey-mond/avocados/blob/main/report.md#research-questions) outlined in `report.md`

`task3.py` implements [task 3](https://github.com/Frey-mond/avocados/blob/main/report.md#research-questions) as outlined in `report.md`

## Run Project

After installing libraries, run `main.py` to generate the plots and results used in `report.md`
